# BrainAgePrediction
On Systematic Bias in Brain Age Estimation using Machine Learning

Brain Age Prediction using Ridge Regression, Gaussian Process Regression, Support Vector Regression and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The DNNs are implemented with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), as reported in the paper below, and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
